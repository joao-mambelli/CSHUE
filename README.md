## About

My name is João but you can call me John. I'm 21 and I live in Rio Claro, São Paulo, Brazil. Currently studing Computer Science in Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP). For now I do internship for an IT company. C#, XAML and C are the languages I like the most, I moved recently from the good old WinForms to WPF and I'm loving the greater variety of things you can do with it. I didn't want to use UWP because there's still a lot of people using Windows 7, but I tried to make the UI as good as in UWP. I got inspired by the Settings app from Windows 10.

As a hardcore CS:GO player I love the game, play it since its early beta versions. I've been playing CS since I was a little kid, when I got my first PC, around 2008. I remember when my friend got home with a CS:S DVD to install it. Before that I didn't even know that FPS was something possible. I simply fell in love with it. The simplicity of the gameplay is what got me.

I decided to make this application because I recently got Philips Hue bulbs and didn't find any good solutions for using it with CS:GO, I wanted something easy to use and very customizable.
