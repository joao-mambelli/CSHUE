## About

I decided to make this application because I recently got Philips Hue bulbs and didn't find any good solutions for using it with CS:GO, I wanted something easy to use and very customizable.

## Full Documentation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/joao7yt/CSHUE/wiki) for full documentation.

## Donations

I don't expect much finantial return from this application, but who knows, right? Donations are always appreciated.
